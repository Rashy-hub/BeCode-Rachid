# Rachid Yagoubi - FullStack JS web developper

<p>I'm trying to retrain for a new career (reconversion) after a burn out working during 4 year and a half iin the same company. I used to be an electronics technician and now I want to become a Fullstack Javascript developer ; I already had a 6 month training with Bruxelles Formation - JavaScript FullStack in 2022 that was more theoritical less practices. Then I trained for several months using online resources (notably openclassroom and hackerranck), and coded  few exos and other mini-applications. As part of the team4job program, I met my mentor who advised me to attend the becode bootcamp, he also was a becoder and now he works at Accenture. I am convinced with your methodology based on practicing code with teammates , I already started few personal projects that i wish to finish with the help of becode coaches and I would like also to learn softs skills because i mainly worked alone those last years. I am now also working on my portfolio and personal projects . </p>
