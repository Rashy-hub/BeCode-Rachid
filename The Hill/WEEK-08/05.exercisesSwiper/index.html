                                    Daenerys Targaryen, the last surviving child of King Aerys II Targaryen, is known as

                                    reclaiming the Iron Throne and ending injustice, Daenerys commands a vast following
                                    and wields three dragons, the first seen in centuries, as she strives to conquer and

                                    Landing, including her forced marriage to Tyrion Lannister and subsequent capture by

                                    independent and rebellious. Unlike her sister Sansa, Arya rejects traditional gender
                                    roles and aspires to be a warrior. Her journey is marked by a relentless quest for
                                    vengeance against those who wronged her family. Arya's adventures take her across

                                    assassin with a list of names to cross off.
